## About task
Hi there! If you are reading you are probably reviewing my test task. It's not perfect and here are some points I would like to change in the future:

- add search
- fix minor UI bugs
- optimize fetching (limit fetching at first to 4 items for example and load others as needed)
- add something on loading
- add animations
- optimize pictures

Hope I will get a chance to deal with it in the nearest future, for now it is as it is
